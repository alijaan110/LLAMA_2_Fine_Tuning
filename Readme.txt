Introduction:
The "Generative AI based Chatbot (ExploreGB)" project aims to revolutionize the tourism experience in Gilgit-Baltistan 
by deploying a cutting-edge chatbot. The initiative involves the collection of a bespoke dataset, comprising over 4000 
questions and answers in JSONL format, catering to the unique needs of tourists. The focus is on leveraging 
state-of-the-art techniques, including Progressive Early-stopping Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Soft Fine-Tuning (SFT), 
to efficiently fine-tune the LLAMA2-7B language model.

Data Collection:
The foundation of this project lies in meticulous data collection. A dataset of 4000+ questions and answers was curated, 
providing a comprehensive understanding of tourist queries specific to Gilgit-Baltistan. The dataset, stored in JSONL 
format, ensures authenticity and relevance in addressing diverse inquiries related to destinations and travel experiences.

Model Fine-Tuning:
The LLAMA2-7B language model, a powerful tool for natural language understanding, was fine-tuned on the custom dataset. 
The process involved the strategic application of PEFT and SFTTraining techniques to enhance computational efficiency. 
This meticulous fine-tuning ensures that the chatbot not only comprehends the intricacies of tourist queries but also 
provides accurate and context-aware responses.

User Interaction and Efficiency:
The developed chatbot acts as a user-friendly interface, enabling tourists to effortlessly seek information about 
Gilgit-Baltistan destinations. The implementation of PEFT and SFTTraining not only optimizes computational resources 
but also enhances the responsiveness of the chatbot, ensuring a seamless and efficient user experience.

Tourism Assistance:
The primary objective of the chatbot is to assist tourists in planning and enjoying their trip to Gilgit-Baltistan. 
By providing authentic and tailored responses to user queries, the chatbot serves as a virtual guide, offering valuable 
insights into destinations, attractions, and travel logistics. This initiative aims to enrich the tourism experience, 
making it more accessible and enjoyable for visitors.
